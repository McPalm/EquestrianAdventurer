		 <string>Ghost are a hassle to fight,
Weapons are weak against this blight.
You would need a special weapon or a charm,
to stand any chance to do them any harm.

I could make one of the latter,
if I had some Ursa Minor Fur.
You can find some of that in the cave to the north west,
Just be graceful in this test.

Avoiding the best would be the wisest measure,
just sneak past it and claim your treasure.</string>
