		"body": "<<if $flag.micherie.help is false>>\r\nI don't know what yet. But the monster activity in the Everfree Forest is increasing. At the moment my hoofs are tied, I have to stay close to Ponyville and react in case of a monster attack. I'm hoping I could get some reinforcement soon enough so I could actually head out there and do some investigation.\r\n<<wait>>\r\n<<clear>>\r\nSay, I have ran into many thrill seekers and explorers in my career and you have that eagerness to move written all over your face. I heard that there is a Zebra living in there with the name of Zecora, surely somebody who actually live in the thick of it would have some more insight into the situation. Now I am not asking you to do my work for me, but if you would decide to explore the forest and happen upon her, would you be so kind as to ask her about the situation on my behalf.\r\n-> Yes\r\n    Brilliant! But please don't get in over yourhead on my behalf. It's always important to stay safe.\r\n    <<set $flag.micherie.help to true>>\r\n-> No\r\n    No matter, as a guard I should not ask you to expose yourself to danger.\r\n<<set $flag.zecora to true>>\r\n<<else>>\r\nHad any suceess?\r\n-> Working on it.\r\n    Thank you for your service, please don't get in over yourhead on my behalf. It's always important to stay safe.\r\n-> I met up with Zecora, she said something about ghosts.<<if $flag.zecora.talked>>\r\n    Oh, Ghosts. That would explain a lot. Ghosts are incredibly dangerous to fight without the proper equipment. Thank you for that information.\r\n<<endif>>",

I would have made it a dancer like most of my peers but it did not stay entirely right with me. I had my true calling elsewhere so to say. A cutiemark is just a talent after all, the weapon, not the warrior or her quest. One thing led to another and I joined the royal guard.
